Hardware Requirements
=====================

Our image reconstruction pipeline is a GPU-based implementation and requires a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU. The recommended minimum GPU specifications are:

* Pulmonary image reconstruction requires at least on 80 GB GPU per echo time.
* Cardiovascular image reconstruction requires at least on 144 GB GPU per echo  time.
* Cardiopulmonary image reconstruction requires at least on 144 GB GPU per echo time .
* CUDA Toolkit version 12.8

Please ensure that your system meets these hardware requirements to effectively run the image reconstruction  provided in this toolbox.

The toolbox has been tested on the following GPU models:

* NVIDIA A100 (80 GB)
* NVIDIA H200  (144 GB)
* NVIDIA H100 NVL (94 GB)
